    "Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential\n",
    "features of the object. Abstraction helps reduce complexity and allows focusing on the\n",
    "interactions at a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: A mechanism where one class (child or subclass) inherits properties\n",
    "and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass). This allows code reuse\n",
    "and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.\n",
    "It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, typically through\n",
    "method overriding (in the case of inheritance) or method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects:\n",
